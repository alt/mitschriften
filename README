This is a XeLaTeX class to write down a lecture in LaTeX on-the-fly. It is intended for high-speed writers who have access to many unicode-characters.

Most of LaTeXs markup is transposed to fancy unicode characters to enable high efficiency when writing.

The output will /not/ be a beatiful document, but some kind of personal notes of a lecture that contains all important formatting.

Compile the dtx file with xelatex to get the class file. Put the latter one anywhere where TeX can find it. The class is only usable with an up-to-date (TeXlive2009) XeLaTeX format. A port to luaLaTeX might happen.

Please feel free to mail me any suggestions, bugfixes, feature requests or anything else:
